# EPrints Thumbnail info export plugin

This plugin is intended to produce a JSON endpoint with details of thumbnails from eprint records.

It is based on the work carried out here:

https://github.com/uol-library/eprints-iiif-manifest

This plugin is intended to expose all thumbnail URLs (by keyword) for images, or the URL of the MP3 file for audio files. Its main purpose is to expose the order of thumbnails to prevent the system it feeds from guessing(!).
